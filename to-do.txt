Levels

Easy
- random move algorithm
- choose a random piece that has a possible move, choose a random direction to move in

Medium
- if there is a possible move to kill off an opponent's piece, implement this
- if no opponent pieces are near, move a random piece forward, starting with the pieces that are closest to the opposite side

Hard
- don't move the last row of chess pieces unless absolutely necessary
- other pieces move to form a pyramid
- get as many pieces to the opposite side
- should be based on user moves, to kill off user pieces and prevent user from reaching this side
