~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Levels

X
- random move algorithm
- choose a random piece that has a possible move, choose a random direction to move in

Easy
- if there is a possible move to kill off an opponent's piece, implement this
- if piece at danger, move away 
- if both of the above are true, randomly select one to do
- if no opponent pieces are near, move a random piece forward

Medium
- 

Hard (??? edit)
- don't move the last row of chess pieces unless absolutely necessary
- other pieces move to form a pyramid
- get as many pieces to the opposite side
- should be based on user moves, to kill off user pieces and prevent user from reaching this side
